# FilterContainer

> Fully qualified class name:  
> `Soatok\Cupcake\FilterContainer`

The `FilterContainer` class extends `ParagonIE\Ionizer\InputFilterContainer`.

The main purpose of `FilterContainer` is to change the Ionizer name separator
from `.` to `::` (since `.` is a legal character in a form element name, but
`::` is not).
